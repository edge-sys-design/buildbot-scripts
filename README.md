# Buildbot Scripts

These scripts are what we use with our buildbot.py tool, to build repos as soon
as they are pushed to.

These are very specific to ESD's build infrastructure, which is why as of right
now, they don't appear in the repos themselves, but instead in this separate
repo. This might change in the future, if we can stop hardcoding paths.
